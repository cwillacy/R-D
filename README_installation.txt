Installing SimWiz
--------------------
To install SimWiz, please download the source files from github.  The link is:

https://github.com/cwillacy/SimWiz/releases

From the Github interface download and install the latest release. You can install the code anywhere on your computer.

For Windows Users
-----------------
You will need a suitable Python installation to run SimWiz along with PYQT.  These can be found in the Anaconda installation: https://www.anaconda.com/.

I recommend running SimWiz from Spyder or other IDE.  The awiz.py is the main routine to run, which will start the GUI.

For Linux Users
---------------  
On Linux it is also advised to run SimWiz in an Anaconda envrionment.  For example, from the command line:

/apps/sss/Anaconda3/5.0.0/bin/python3 awiz.py

This assumes you invoke awiz.py from the SimWiz installation directory.
